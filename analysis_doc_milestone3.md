# ClimateScope Project – Milestone 3 Analysis Document  

## Objective  
To enhance the ClimateScope dashboard by adding advanced interactivity, improved UI/UX design, and additional functionality for in-depth climate trend analysis and anomaly detection.

## Process Overview  
Building upon the previous milestones, Milestone 3 concentrated on enriching user engagement and visual presentation of climate data for better insights and natural storytelling.

### 1️⃣ Multi-Country Comparison and Filtering  
-Enabled multi-select for countries to compare multiple regions simultaneously.  

-Updated plots and data tables to dynamically adjust based on multi-country selections.

### 2️⃣ Enhanced Visualization Options  
-Added toggle to switch between Line, Bar, and Heatmap charts for time-series climate data.  

-Show climate variable trends by month and year with flexible charting styles.

### 3️⃣ Highlights of Extreme Events  
-Incorporated anomaly detection results showing extreme temperature and precipitation events.  

-Marked these extremes with red cross markers on applicable charts for easy spotting.  

### 4️⃣ Download and Export Features  
-Implemented buttons allowing export of filtered datasets as CSV and chart images as PNG.  

-Supported ease of sharing and offline analysis without code.

### 5️⃣ UI/UX Improvements with Climate Theme  
-Applied a cohesive dark climate-themed background image with transparent content containers.  

-Styled sidebar and main area with uniform fonts, colors, and spacing for holistic visual harmony.  

-Removed blocky UI sections so charts and text blend naturally with the background.

### 6️⃣ Expanded Year Range Slider  
-Increased year filter from fixed 1980–2030 range, defaulting to dataset min/max for flexibility.

### 7️⃣ User Assistance and Help Panels  
-Provided detailed sidebar help and FAQ for easy onboarding and navigation.

### 8️⃣ Interactive Date Range Filtering
-Added intuitive calendar-based date range selector beside the year slider for granular period filtering on monthly data.
